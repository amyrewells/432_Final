***NCBI ascension numbers:***

(found in “Data Availability” section of original article)

KX459698- KX460822

***Files used:***

Mapping file (mapping.txt): Contains metadata about each sample,
including species, diet, and experimental conditions.

OTU table (OTU_table.xls converted to OTU_table.csv): Contains
operational taxonomic unit (OTU) abundances per sample, based on 16S
rRNA sequencing.

OTU sequences (Deposited in NCBI): Can be used for phylogenetic
analysis.

## Biological Questions & Methods

***Question 1:***

Does microbiome composition differ significantly between dung beetle
species (irrespective of life-stage or sex), and can these differences
be used for species classification?

**Method:** Use distance matrix and non-metric multidimensional scaling
(NMDS) to visualize microbiome clustering by species. Apply Random
Forest classification to identify OTUs that best differentiate species.
Assess model performance using ROC curves or boxplots of key OTUs.

***Question 2:***

How do OTU abundance patterns influence microbial community structure
across dung beetle samples?

**Method:** Perform NMDS using two approaches: Relative abundance-based
NMDS to examine quantitative differences. Presence/absence-based NMDS to
assess compositional shifts. Identify dominant bacterial families for
each species using barplots (extract families using regex from OTU
taxonomic lineages). Compare results to determine if community structure
is driven more by presence/absence or relative abundance

***Question 3:***

How do microbial communities of each dung beetle species differ in terms
of taxonomic diversity and phylogenetic structure?

**Method**: Use BLAST to identify OTUs from the NCBI database. Perform
multiple sequence alignment using MUSCLE. Construct a phylogenetic tree
and visualize distances using a heatmap. Investigate if certain
microbial taxa remain species-specific despite identical rearing
conditions (indicative of host-dependent symbionts).

### Dataset Structure & Pre-processing

Overview of dataset structure Number of samples: The data contain
details of various kinds of dung beetles. It contains a fixed number of
samples (for more information, refer to the metadata file). Every sample
is from a single dung beetle under various experimental conditions
Metadata variables: Species: Indicates what type of dung beetle the
sample was taken from Diet: What beetles eat, which can alter the kind
of germs that are present Life stage: Whether the sample is from an
adult or larval beetle Experimental condition: Various circumstances
under which the samples were collected (such as alterations in the
environment or diet). Sequencing depth: The quantity of sequencing reads
obtained from each sample (crucial for normalization) OTU table: Rows =
OTUs, columns = samples, values = abundance counts. Taxonomic
resolution: family, genus, species (depends on classification
confidence). Preprocessing steps Filter low-abundance OTUs: Remove OTUs
with \<0.01% relative abundance across samples. Threshold: Filter out
OTUs having a relative abundance of less than 0.01% across all samples.
This eliminates OTUs that likely do not contribute significantly to the
structure of the microbial community, minimizing noise within the data.
Rarefaction: Standardize sequencing depth across samples to mitigate
library size biases. Purpose: Ensure that each sample has the same
sequencing amount. Additional sequencing in certain samples can result
in unfair comparisons. Rarefaction prevents this by employing smaller
samples to provide equal sequencing depth for each sample. Method:
Randomly select a given number of sequences from each sample. The number
is taken from the smallest sample. This serves to decrease any potential
biases from library size that may be introduced to subsequent analyses.
Changing Information Log Transformation: Transform the OTU abundance
data with a log transformation. This transformation makes the values
smaller and less sensitive to extremely high OTUs, making the data more
suitable for NMDS (Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling) and other
statistical procedures requiring normally distributed data. Convert the
OTU abundance to a simple yes or no for compositional analysis. This
indicates whether each OTU is found in a sample or not. This allows one
to examine changes in community composition without concerning oneself
with how much of each OTU is present. This is particularly critical when
examining which OTUs tend to be present or absent across different
species. Data transformation: Log-transform OTU abundance for NMDS.
Convert OTU presence/absence to a binary matrix for compositional
analysis
